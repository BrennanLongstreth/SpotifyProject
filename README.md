# SpotifyProject
Unfortunately the way that I pushed this, my code is in the Master branch and not the main branch of this REPO  

Required files in the same directory as 'Project.ipynb': 'artist_genres.csv', 'StreamingHistory.json'
There is no need to touch anything within the code.
All data is read from files that were taken from an API so no new tokens or requests are needed.
Just restart the kernel and run the whole file. (It will take a few seconds to finish)

If you want to check that the code finished running the last cell prints 'done'
